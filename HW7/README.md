**The src folder contains:**
- The source code for this homework labeled as Cars.java. It contains the main program, car class, odometer class and fuel gauge class all on same file.


**The logs folder contains:**
- The screenshots of output of the program. Since the output was too long, I split it into 3 separate png files labeled as "CarsOutput1.png", "CarsOutput2.png" and "CarsOutput3.png"
