**The src folder contains three sub-folders for all three programs required for HW3. The source code for each program is under these sub-folders.**
- Program1.java computes the factorial, sum of squares and Fibonacci sequence for various integers
- Program2.java computes the area and radius/perimeter for either a rectangle or a circle
- Program3.java computes the age of various records based on dates

**The necessary input files are also inside each sub-folder labeled "inputfile.txt."**

**The logs folder contains screenshots for all possible outputs for each program. The names of each screenshot file should match each program number.**
