The src folder contains three sub-folders for all three programs required for HW3. The source code for each program is under these sub-folders. 
The necessary input files are also inside each sub-folder labeled "inputfile.txt." 
The logs folder contains screenshots for all possible outputs for each program. The names of each screenshot file should match each program number.
